## God Nodes (most connected - your core abstractions)
1. `handleRun()` - 3 edges
2. `getScheduleNode()` - 2 edges
3. `executeOnce()` - 2 edges

## Surprising Connections (you probably didn't know these)
- None detected - all connections are within the same source files.

## Knowledge Gaps
- **Thin community `Agent Manager`** (2 nodes): `AgentManager()`, `AgentManager.tsx`
  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.
- **Thin community `Block Palette`** (2 nodes): `handleDragStart()`, `BlockPalette.tsx`
  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.
- **Thin community `Backtest Strip`** (2 nodes): `clsx()`, `BacktestConfigStrip.tsx`
  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.
- **Thin community `Canvas Wrapper`** (2 nodes): `FlowCanvas.tsx`, `FlowCanvas()`
  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.
- **Thin community `Module Exports`** (1 nodes): `index.ts`
  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.
- **Thin community `Agent Sidebar`** (1 nodes): `AgentSidebar.tsx`
  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.
- **Thin community `Backtest Summary`** (1 nodes): `BacktestSummaryModal.tsx`
  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.
- **Thin community `Node Palette`** (1 nodes): `NodePalette.tsx`

  Too small to be a meaningful cluster - may be noise or needs more connections extracted.

## Suggested Questions
_Not enough signal to generate questions. This usually means the corpus has no AMBIGUOUS edges, no bridge nodes, no INFERRED relationships, and all communities are tightly cohesive. Add more files or run with --mode deep to extract richer edges._
