### [2026-05-03 15:22:40 Z] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: tests/test_integration.py
- upgrade_summary: Added a full ATS integration test suite that validates cross-module communication across orchestrator graph routing, Redis handoffs, Agent6 execution flow, stop-loss monitoring, Postgres receipt updates, RAG/chat grounding, API-to-pipeline wiring, and startup lifecycle behavior. The suite uses real internal module wiring while mocking only external systems.

### [2026-05-03 13:55:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=market_place
- upgrade_paths: components/marketplace/buy-panel.tsx, components/creator/publish-wizard.tsx, app/(app)/marketplace/page.tsx, app/(app)/marketplace/strategies/[id]/page.tsx, app/(app)/creator/page.tsx, components/agent-builder/canvas/PublishModal.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Implemented full marketplace frontend. Created BuyPanel (wagmi useSendTransaction/useWriteContract EVM payment → treasury → POST purchase API → Activate Now unlock). Created 4-step PublishWizard (details/risk/privacy+pricing/preview with AES-256-GCM encryption info, free/paid toggle, payout wallet). Rewrote marketplace home with featured horizontal scroll row, platform picks, trending, new arrivals, free/paid sections, and filter sidebar (pricing, risk, win rate floor, asset, regime). Rewrote strategy detail with prominent stat tiles, alpha score, human_summary display, BuyPanel in sidebar, perf tabs, version history, no code exposure. Created creator dashboard with metrics bar (activations, purchases, earnings), strategy/indicator tables with actions, draft continuation links. Wired PublishModal to render PublishWizard for strategy mode, keeping flat indicator form.

### [2026-05-03 08:20:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: supabase/migrations/20260503000000_marketplace_payments.sql, app/api/creator/strategies/[id]/publish/route.ts
- upgrade_summary: Added marketplace payments migration (is_free/price columns on strategies, zerog_root_hash on strategy_versions, strategy_purchases table with RLS). Updated publish route to AES-256-GCM encrypt strategy payload via sealStrategyPayload(), store rootHash in strategy_versions.zerog_root_hash, write only the encrypted marker to the payload column, and auto-generate human_summary via generateHumanSummary() when not supplied by the caller.

### [2026-05-03 08:10:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: lib/zerog/private-strategy.ts, lib/zerog/index.ts, .env.example
- upgrade_summary: Created strategy privacy layer (`lib/zerog/private-strategy.ts`) — AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt of compiled strategy payloads, upload/download via 0G Storage, and `generateHumanSummary()` via sealed qwen3.6-plus inference. Added STRATEGY_ENCRYPTION_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_WALLET to .env.example. Barrel re-export added to lib/zerog/index.ts.

### [2026-05-03 07:12:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: doc/idea.md
- upgrade_summary: Added comprehensive 0G protocol integration mapping to the ATS idea doc. Section 2.4 documents exactly where each 0G component is used: 0G Chain (Layer 3 execution), 0G Storage (persistent agent memory — KV state + Log history, Decision Receipt storage with root hash), 0G Compute (Conversation Layer with qwen3-8b, sealed ZK inference via qwen3.6-plus/GLM-5-FP8 for Signal Agent causal gate and Risk Agent pre-trade gate), 0G DA (swarm coordination messages, large inference result blobs, market data attestation). Updated Chain Adapter table, ML Stack table, and Decision Receipt structure to reference 0G fields.

### [2026-05-03 09:17:00 Z] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: ats/agents/execution/__init__.py, ats/agents/execution/dex_client.py, ats/agents/execution/order_router.py, ats/agents/execution/fill_monitor.py, ats/agents/execution/portfolio_updater.py, ats/agents/execution/stop_loss_monitor.py, ats/agents/agent6_execution.py, ats/orchestrator/graph.py, ats/api/main.py, tests/test_phase7.py

### [2026-05-03 15:22:40 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: tests/test_integration.py
- upgrade_summary: Added a full ATS integration test suite that validates cross-module communication across orchestrator graph routing, Redis handoffs, Agent6 execution flow, stop-loss monitoring, Postgres receipt updates, RAG/chat grounding, API-to-pipeline wiring, and startup lifecycle behavior. The suite uses real internal module wiring while mocking only external systems.

### [2026-05-03 18:04:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: supabase/migrations/20260503_agent_wallets.sql, supabase/migrations/20260503_user_settings.sql, supabase/migrations/20260503_decision_receipts.sql, lib/agent-wallet/crypto.ts, lib/agent-wallet/manager.ts, app/api/agent-wallet/route.ts, app/api/agent-wallet/withdraw/route.ts, app/api/user-settings/route.ts, .env.local
- upgrade_summary: Implemented ATS agent wallet infrastructure: three Supabase migrations (agent_wallets encrypted burner EOA table, user_settings with encrypted API key + model/mode, decision_receipts ATS extension with agent_votes/regime/causal_chain/risk_sizing/consensus columns). Added lib/agent-wallet/crypto.ts (AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt using AGENT_WALLET_MASTER_KEY), lib/agent-wallet/manager.ts (getOrCreateAgentWallet — generates viem burner EOA, encrypts private key, upserts to Supabase), GET+POST /api/agent-wallet (init + balance check), POST /api/agent-wallet/withdraw (native + ERC-20 sweep back to user wallet), GET+PUT /api/user-settings (encrypted API key + model + mode). Added AGENT_WALLET_MASTER_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY placeholders to .env.local.

### [2026-05-03 18:42:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: components/portfolio/AgentWalletCard.tsx, components/portfolio/AgentSettingsCard.tsx, components/portfolio/index.ts, app/(app)/portfolio/page.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Rewrote AgentWalletCard to self-fetch from /api/agent-wallet — shows real burner EOA address, A0GI balance, copy+explorer link, status pill (Not Initialized / Needs Funding / Initialized / Ready for Autonomous Mode), Fund (SendToAgentDialog via wagmi useSendTransaction) and Sweep Back buttons. Added new AgentSettingsCard with masked OpenRouter API-key input, model dropdown (Claude/Gemini/GPT-4o/Qwen3), and trading-mode radio (Autonomous/Assisted/Solo) persisted via PUT /api/user-settings. Updated portfolio page to 3-equal-column grid (NetWorth | AgentWallet | AgentSettings) and auto-triggers POST /api/agent-wallet on first visit to initialize the burner EOA.

### [2026-05-03 18:54:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: lib/ats/types.ts, lib/ats/llm.ts, lib/ats/data/prices.ts, lib/ats/data/news.ts, lib/ats/indicators.ts, lib/ats/causal-chains.json
- upgrade_summary: Bootstrapped the ATS core library. types.ts defines all shared types (AgentVote, Regime, Mode, Decision, DecisionReceipt, RunEvent, Candle, DataBundle, NewsBundle, TechnicalSignals, SentimentScore, CausalChainEntry). llm.ts is a thin OpenRouter client that resolves the user's encrypted API key + model from user_settings then falls back to env OPENROUTER_API_KEY; exports callLLM, callLLMJson, streamLLM. prices.ts fetches CoinGecko OHLC (90d daily + 7d sub-daily) with volume back-fill and a quality score. news.ts fetches CoinDesk/CoinTelegraph/The Block RSS, parses raw XML, deduplicates, and tags items with recognised ticker symbols. indicators.ts implements SMA, EMA, RSI-14 (Wilder), MACD-12/26/9, Bollinger Bands-20, ATR-14, and a computeTechnicalSignals() convenience bundle. causal-chains.json seeds 30 documented crypto causal chains (trigger conditions, affected assets, reliability scores) for use by the Signal Agent.

### [2026-05-03 19:30:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: lib/ats/agents/data-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/regime-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/signal-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/graph-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/risk-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/execution-agent.ts, lib/ats/orchestrator.ts
- upgrade_summary: Implemented all 6 ATS agents and the orchestrator. Data Agent fetches price+news bundles in parallel and emits quality metrics. Regime Agent uses a rules-based HMM-lite (30d volatility, 7d slope, RSI, volume ratio) followed by LLM validation to classify market regime (bull_trending/volatile, bear_volatile, sideways, accumulation, distribution). Signal Agent runs 4 parallel sub-modules — pure-JS Technical (35%), LLM Sentiment (30%), LLM Causal-chain (20%), LLM Institutional (15%) — weighted into a combined AgentVote. Graph Agent computes BTC-correlation from a static mid-2025 matrix + dynamic candle adjustment, then uses LLM enrichment for cross-asset directional implication. Risk Agent applies fractional Kelly criterion (25% multiplier) with hard veto rules (data quality, drawdown, Kelly sign, min trade size, consensus absence). Execution Agent dispatches to UniswapV2 (0G) or V3 (Ethereum SwapRouter02) based on chain registry router type; handles ERC-20 approval and placeholder-address detection. Orchestrator runs the full 5-phase pipeline (data → parallel agents → risk → consensus → execution), persists DecisionReceipt to Supabase decision_receipts, and emits typed RunEvents at every step for SSE streaming.

### [2026-05-03 19:55:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: app/api/research/run/route.ts, app/api/research/receipts/route.ts
- upgrade_summary: Added /api/research/run SSE endpoint and /api/research/receipts list endpoint. The run route authenticates via requireWallet, parses {query, ticker?, mode?, chainId?, executionApproved?}, loads user mode from user_settings (fallback to solo), idempotently initialises the agent wallet for Kelly balance estimation, streams all RunEvents from runOrchestrator as text/event-stream, then best-effort uploads the final DecisionReceipt blob to 0G Storage via saveAgentMemory and back-fills storage_root_hash in decision_receipts. The receipts route returns paginated ATS receipts for the authenticated user with optional ticker filter.

### [2026-05-03 20:30:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: store/research.ts, components/research/nodes/AgentNode.tsx, components/research/AgentGraphCanvas.tsx, components/research/ResearchChat.tsx, components/research/DecisionReceiptDrawer.tsx, app/(app)/research/page.tsx, components/layout/header.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Built the /research page UI: Zustand store (store/research.ts) managing xyflow nodes/edges + chat messages + currentReceipt with a single applyEvent() dispatcher; AgentNode custom xyflow node with idle/thinking/done/vetoed states, confidence bar, Signal Agent sub-task pills; AgentGraphCanvas (@xyflow/react) with 7 nodes in phase-ordered layout, animated edges on dataflow, legend, run-ID badge; ResearchChat consuming SSE from /api/research/run, quick-ticker selector, abort control; DecisionReceiptDrawer (Sheet) showing full structured receipt (trigger, regime, agent votes, consensus, risk sizing, causal chains, tx hash). Added Research + Terminal links to header nav.

### [2026-05-03 21:10:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: store/research.ts, components/research/ResearchChat.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Wired Autonomous/Assisted/Solo mode branching in chat UI. store/research.ts gains PendingApproval type, pendingApproval state, and clearPendingApproval action; applyEvent now sets pendingApproval on execution.pending(awaiting_approval=true) and clears it on run.start/run.done/run.error/execution.done. ResearchChat tracks lastQueryRef, passes executionApproved flag to /api/research/run on re-send, and shows an ApprovalBanner (Approve & Execute / Dismiss) when mode=assisted and pendingApproval is set. Header mode badge shows coloured Auto/Assisted/Solo pill; empty state shows mode-specific description.

### [2026-05-03 21:25:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: app/terminal/_components/TradePanel.tsx, app/terminal/page.tsx, components/research/ResearchChat.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Added agent-activity strip and deep-link approval flow to terminal. TradePanel gains AgentActivityStrip (collapsible list of last 5 ATS receipts from /api/research/receipts showing decision/ticker/size/tx status) and AgentApprovalBanner (shown when terminal is opened via /terminal?from=research&runId=...&decision=...&sizeUsd=...&ticker=...&query=... — streams /api/research/run with executionApproved=true and shows tx hash on completion). ResearchChat ApprovalBanner gains an "Execute in Terminal" button that deep-links to /terminal with all approval context encoded in URL params. terminal/page.tsx wraps TradePanel in Suspense for useSearchParams support.

### [2026-05-03 20:20:14 +0530] agent=codex user=anik branch=main
- upgrade_paths: app/terminal/layout.tsx, graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, graphify-out/graph.html, graphify-out/graph.json
- upgrade_summary: Wrapped the standalone terminal route with theme and Wagmi wallet providers, and marked it force-dynamic so wallet-dependent terminal hooks do not prerender outside provider context during deployment builds. Refreshed Graphify metadata for the code change.

### [2026-05-03 20:00:05 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: lib/axl/types.ts, lib/axl/config.ts, lib/axl/client.ts, lib/axl/index.ts, lib/ats/remote-agents.ts, lib/ats/orchestrator.ts, app/api/research/run/route.ts, scripts/axl-agent-service.ts, scripts/axl-demo.ts, package.json, .env.example, README.md, doc/axl.md, doc/guideline.md
- upgrade_summary: Added Gensyn AXL transport so ATS Regime/Signal/Graph/Risk agents can run on separate AXL peer nodes via MCP tools/call. Orchestrator selects local|axl|auto per run; remote adapters re-emit peer RunEvents tagged with payload.axl. New scripts: axl-agent-service hosts the agents as an MCP service registered with the AXL MCP router; axl-demo verifies topology, router, and one AXL-backed ATS run. Docs and env.example updated for hackathon submission.

### [2026-05-03 19:43:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: .env.local
- upgrade_summary: Verified all three agent capabilities (research, trade, swap) against live OpenRouter API key. Added missing OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY alias to .env.local so the canvas agent route (app/api/agent-builder/agent/route.ts) can resolve the key alongside OPENROUTER_API_KEY. All four tests passed: research inference (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite), swap canvas build (Claude Sonnet 4.5), LimitOrder trade logic, and SwapNode slippage math.

### [2026-05-03 19:13:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: supabase/migrations/20260503_decision_receipts.sql, lib/ats/orchestrator.ts, app/api/research/receipts/route.ts, app/api/dev-migrate/route.ts, scripts/migrate-ats.ts, scripts/test-llm.mjs, scripts/create-ats-receipts.mjs
- upgrade_summary: Full end-to-end test with real OpenRouter API key (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite). Discovered decision_receipts table had strategy_version_id NOT NULL constraint blocking ATS receipt inserts. Fixed by replacing ALTER TABLE approach with a dedicated public.ats_receipts table (cleaner separation from marketplace receipts). Updated orchestrator and receipts API to use ats_receipts. Fixed stored API key missing sk-or-v1- prefix causing silent LLM fallbacks. Confirmed: data agent fetches real CoinGecko prices, regime/signal/causal/graph agents make real LLM calls, risk agent applies Kelly sizing, receipts persist to Supabase. Pipeline fully functional — BTC analysis returned BUY (95% confidence) with institutional causal chain active.

### [2026-05-03 21:36:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: components/layout/header.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Added "Builder" nav item pointing to /agent-builder with Cpu icon; it was missing from navItems despite the route existing.

### [2026-05-03 21:49:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: components/layout/header.tsx, components/ui/nav-bar.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Fixed nav overflow — replaced absolute/centered nav with flex-1 layout so Builder (9th item) is never clipped; reduced item padding px-6→px-3.5 and gap gap-3→gap-0.5 for a compact, fully-visible nav.
