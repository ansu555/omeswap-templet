description: session codebase change recorder
alwaysApply: true
-----------------

## Codebase Record Rule

* After every session, append a new entry to `@file:record.md`
* Keep entries **minimal (1–2 lines max)**

## Format

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
user: <github-username>
branch: <branch-name>
changes: <short summary>
```

## Constraints

* Do NOT read `record.md` unless explicitly instructed by the user
* Do NOT edit or delete previous entries
* Only append new entries
* No explanations, no extra text — just the record

## Example

```
[2026-04-29 18:42]
user: anikdas
branch: feature/ui-terminal
changes: added chart layout, integrated indicators
```
